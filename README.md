### Hi there 👋

My name is Coralys, and I'm an aspiring Business Intelligence Analyst. 

❤️‍🔥 I carry with me a passion for psychology, data, and problem-solving. As a former psychology student and graduate research assistant, my understanding of human behavior and experience in data collection was the real start of my data analytic journey. My time in the field has equipped me with a unique perspective for interpreting and analyzing data in the context of business intelligence--making for a surprisingly smooth transition into tech. 


👩‍💻 Through the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) program with TripleTen, I've developed a solid foundation in Advanced Spreadsheets, SQL, and Python, as well as Tableau and Power BI. I've also completed several diverse projects that demonstrate my ability to extract insights from complex datasets. One notable project involved transforming raw data from an e-commerce company into analytical insights through the creation of a conversion funnel, conducting cohort analysis, and analyzing retention rates. My most recently completed project has by far been the most fun, where I created my first dashboard using Tableau Public for a Superstore in profit peril. 


🥅 My overall goal is to use the technical skills I've gained in BIA, combine them with my personal interests, and support industries that promote passion, wellness, and positive change for the future. By learning how to facilitate data-driven decision-making and collaboration, I aim to contribute to the healing and well-being of a broader audience. 


🙏 Outside of BIA, I'm a lover of spirituality, engaging my mind, and practicing self-care for my overall health. I also recently received my Reiki Level 1 and 2 Certification.
