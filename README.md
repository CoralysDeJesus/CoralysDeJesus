### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Coralys, and I'm an aspiring Business Intelligence Analyst. 

I carry with me a passion for psychology, data, problem-solving, and pattern recognition. Through the Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) program with TripleTen, I've developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, and Advanced Spreadsheets. I've completed several diverse projects that demonstrate my ability to extract insights from complex datasets. As a former psychology student and graduate research assistant, my understanding of human behavior and experience in data collection was the real start of my data analytic journey. It's equipped me with a unique perspective on interpreting and analyzing data in the context of business intelligence, making for a surprisingly smooth transition into tech.

As part of my enrollment in the BIA program with TripleTen, I've worked on several projects. Currently, I'm working on a BIA project and report where I transform raw data from an e-commerce company into analytical insights through the building of a conversion funnel, cohort analysis, and retention rates.

Outside of BIA, I'm a lover of spirituality, psychology, and self-care practices for mental health and recently received my Reiki Level 1 & 2 Certification.

My overall goal is to leverage the BIA technical proficiency I've obtained, integrate it with my personal interests, and offer support to industries focused on holistic wellness solutions for their clientele. By facilitating data-driven decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency, I aim to contribute to the healing and well-being of a broader audience.
